...................Constructor..................

Spacial method invoked automatically at
time of object creation, Used for intialization.

> same name as class
> constructor does't have a return type
> Only called once (automatically), at object creation
> Memory allocation happens when constructor is called


................Types of Constructor...................
1. Non Parameterized Constructor
2. Parameterized Constructor
3. Copy Constructor
    > Shallow Copy
    > Deep Copy

................Spacial pointer...................

"this" is a Spacial pointer in C++ that points to the current object.

syntax:
    this->prop is same as *(this).prop

.................Copy Constructor.................

Spacial Constructor (default) used to copy properties of one object into another.

>   Shallow copy: A shallow copy of an object copies
    all of the member from one object to another.

>   Deep copy: A deep copy, on the other hand not only copies the member values
    but also make copies of any dinamiclly allocated memory that the members point to.


.....................destructor...........................

destructor: this is opposite of constructor. it will run automatically before end of program.

default destructor deallocate only statically allocated memory.
that's why we need deallocate dynamically allocated memory manually.
