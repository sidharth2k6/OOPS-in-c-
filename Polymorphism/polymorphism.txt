Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different
ways depending on the context in which they are used;

Compile Time Polymorphism:

1. Constructor overloading
2. Function overloading


Run Time Polymorphism:

1.  Function overiding: Parent and child both contains the same function with
    diffrent implementation, The parent class function is said to be overridden.

2.  vertual function: virtual function is a member function that you
    expect to be redefined in derived(child) classes.

    > virtual functions are dynamic in nature
    > defined by the keyword "virtual" inside a base class and are always
      declared with a base class and overridden in a child classes.
    > A virtual function is called during Runtime
